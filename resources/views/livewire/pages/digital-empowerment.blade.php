                <p class="text-muted">In todayâ€™s world, access to technology is no longer a luxuryâ€”it is a necessity. Yet, millions of people, particularly those from ethnic minority and low-income backgrounds, remain digitally excluded.

At <strong>EmpowerEdTech Innovations Foundation</strong>, we are committed to bridging the digital divide through our Digital Empowerment programs.</p>
